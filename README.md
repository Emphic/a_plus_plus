Custom MacBook login screen and pam modules using multipeer connectivity and usb hardware checks with iOS app for sign in.

//TODO:

//Actual Login Screen implementation (other than pam module for sudo, su, etc)

//Screensaver implementation

//Better documentation

The files are not commented very well, so I apologize for that.

All .so files for pam development on macos are for arm64.
